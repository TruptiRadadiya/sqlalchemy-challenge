## Climate Data Analysis and Exploration

This project involves analyzing climate data from Hawaii using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The project is divided into two parts: Data Analysis and Exploration, and Creating a Flask API. The data is provided in a SQLite database file (hawaii.sqlite), and the objective is to perform climate analysis and make the results accessible through a Flask web application.

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your local machine.
- Required Python libraries: SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask.

### Tools and Technologies

- SQLAlchemy for database management.
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Flask for creating the web API.

### Installation

- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:
- Open 'climate_starter.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook and follow the steps to complete the climate analysis and data exploration.
- Run the Flask app using 'app.py'
